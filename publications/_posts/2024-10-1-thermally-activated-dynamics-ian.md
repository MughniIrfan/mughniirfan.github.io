While experiments and simulations have provided a rich picture of the dynamic heterogeneity in glasses at constant temperature or under steady shear, the dynamics of glasses under oscillatory shear remain comparatively less explored. Recent work has shown that oscillatory shear protocols can embed a ``memory'' into a glass's structure, whereby the material will exhibit dynamics that are encoded by the oscillatory shear protocol applied. However, most of the computational work studying the memory effect has been performed in the zero temperature limit, and the effects of thermalization are poorly characterized. In this work, we use nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to study the dynamics of a model two-dimensional glass former at low, non-zero temperatures under oscillatory shear. While we show that the systems' dynamics are independent of sample preparation for either small or larger strain amplitudes, the dynamics become distinct near the yield point when the deformation is applied at finite temperature. We then characterize the dynamic heterogeneity using two metrics, one derived from the vibrational modes and one that exploits machine learning to identify regions prone to rearrangement. This analysis provides evidence that the dynamics below and above yield emerge from distinct structural origins that may be important for developing improved constitutive models that can predict memory in disordered solids.
