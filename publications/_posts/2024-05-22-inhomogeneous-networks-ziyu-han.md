Inhomogeneous crosslinked polymers are powerful platforms for materials design, because they can be synthesized from materials that provide complimentary properties to the resulting gel. For example, a membrane with both glassy and rubbery domains will be mechanically robust while enabling transport. The dynamics, and mechanical and failure properties of rubbery/glassy conetworks are only beginning to be studied, and there is likely to be strong heterogeneities in the dynamics and mechanical response. In this study, we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to generate microphase separated rubbery/glassy polymer networks with a bicontinuous morphology via in silico crosslinking. We study the effect of phase boundary on the local mobility gradient, and our simulation results reveal an asymmetric shift in the local mobility gradient across the interface that extends deeper into the phase with a lower Tg when the system temperature is between the glass transition temperatures of the two phases. Moreover, by employing a model that allows bond breaking, we examine the microscopic mechanism for failure in these networks as a function of the molecular weight of polymer strands between crosslinks and the number fraction of the glassy domain. Under uniaxial extension, we find that the stress is initially larger in the glassy domain. As the deformation proceeds, the segmental dynamics of the two phases homogenize, and subsequently bond breaking begins.
