Dr Muhayy Ud Din Received his Ph.D. in Automatic Control, Robotics, and Computer Vision from the Institute of Industrial and Control Engineering at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), Barcelona, Spain, in 2018. During PhD, he participated as a researcher in R&D projects of Spanish and Catalonian Governments. Moreover, as a short-term research scholar, he visited other research labs (Kavraki Lab, RICE University, USA, and Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics, German Aerospace Center). He worked as a Research and Development Engineer at ITK System Engineering from 2019 to 2022, where he was involved in robotic software development. Since 2022, he is working as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the KU Center for Autonomous Robotic Systems (KUCARS) at Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, UAE. His research interests include marine robotics, Large Language Models for Task Planning, motion planning under uncertainties, manipulation planning, and robotic software development.
