Hi, I am Dongqi and I’m a Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering PhD candidate in the Riggleman Group. I received my B.S. in Chemical Engineering from Tianjin University in China. My research is centered on modeling polymer systems, especially on nano-scale self-assembly through associative interactions. I also worked on deep learning and its application on block copolymer systems. My goal is to bridge physics-based simulations with data-driven approaches to accelerate the understanding and design of polymer materials.
