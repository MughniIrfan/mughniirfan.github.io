Hi! My name is Yerim, and I’m a PhD student in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. I earned both my B.S. and M.S. in Chemical Engineering from Sookmyung Women’s University in South Korea. My master’s research focused on developing nanomaterials for eco-friendly applications.
Currently, I study phase separation in polymer systems using field-based simulations, with a particular interest in complex coacervate systems and the physical mechanisms behind biomolecular condensation.
Outside the lab, I enjoy swimming, playing the piano, and exploring new places around the city.
