Started my career in the Ed-Tech sector working for a startup and helping scale it to an SME. I am familiar with the fast-paced, ever-changing dynamics of startup culture and skilled in product management. I have a strong engineering background, graduating cum laude with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering, and I also worked as a visiting faculty member (career in Pakistan, 2019-2021).

I completed my master's degree in computer vision from Jeonbuk National University, South Korea, while working as a computer vision researcher at Core Intelligent Institute of Intelligent Robotics. I then joined industry as an AI and robotics engineer at WeGo Robotics in Yongin, Seoul Metropolitan Area, where I worked with cutting-edge technologies (career in South Korea, 2022-2024).

Currently, I am working as a computer vision researcher at KU Centre for Autonomous Robot Systems (KUCARS) (career in UAE, 2025-present).
