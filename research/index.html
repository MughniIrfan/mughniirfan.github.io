    The AREIS Lab conducts interdisciplinary research on intelligent robotic systems that integrate advanced perception, artificial intelligence, and compliant actuation to address real-world challenges across marine robotics, wildlife conservation, healthcare, and agriculture. The lab develops autonomous marine and aerial robots for operation in GNSS-denied and visually degraded environments, with strong contributions in underwater vision, SLAM, inspection, and LLM-assisted robotic autonomy. In parallel, the lab advances robotics-enabled wildlife conservation through bio-inspired platforms and non-invasive monitoring systems for ecological observation. A long-standing research focus in healthcare robotics encompasses wearable and assistive devices, variable stiffness actuation, safe human–robot interaction, rehabilitation technologies, and AI-driven sensing and diagnosis. In agricultural robotics, the lab delivers precision farming solutions through deep learning–based crop monitoring, disease detection, robotic pollination, multimodal perception, and autonomous UAV and ground platforms. Collectively, the lab’s research aims to create robust, human-centered, and sustainable robotic technologies with impact across natural, industrial, and healthcare environments.
