The lab conducts extensive research in marine and underwater robotics with a focus on robust autonomy, perception, and inspection in complex and GNSS-denied maritime environments. A major emphasis is placed on underwater vision, including image enhancement, super-resolution, and no-reference image quality assessment to address visibility degradation caused by turbidity and lighting variability. The lab advances underwater SLAM through multi-sensor fusion, learning-based navigation, and systematic analysis of dataset and simulation biases. Autonomous robotic systems, including ROVs and UAVs, are developed for aquaculture net-pen inspection, maritime surveillance, and search operations, leveraging semantic segmentation, active vision, and real-time perception. Recent work integrates large language models with marine robots to enable adaptive inspection, improved human–robot interaction, and coordinated multi-robot operations, contributing to scalable and intelligent marine monitoring solutions.
