Healthcare robotics represents a core research pillar of the lab, with a strong focus on human-centered design, physical human–robot interaction, and rehabilitation technologies. The lab has made significant contributions to wearable and assistive robotic systems, including supernumerary robotic fingers, soft robotic gloves, and compliant exoskeleton components aimed at restoring or augmenting human motor function. A foundational area of work involves the design, modeling, and control of variable stiffness actuators to ensure safety and adaptability during close human interaction. The lab also develops haptic interfaces and sensory substitution systems to enhance perception and motor control. In parallel, learning-based methods are employed for motion prediction, gait analysis, and activity recognition, as well as for medical image analysis supporting disease detection and diagnosis. Together, these efforts advance intelligent, safe, and clinically relevant robotic healthcare solutions.
