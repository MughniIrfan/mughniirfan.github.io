The lab’s research in wildlife conservation focuses on the development of robotic and AI-enabled systems for non-invasive ecological monitoring and behavioral analysis. Bio-inspired and animal-like robotic platforms are designed to operate within natural environments while minimizing disturbance to wildlife. Autonomous robotic systems and aerial platforms are employed for long-term monitoring in remote and sensitive ecosystems, where conventional sensing is challenging. The lab also applies advanced computer vision and learning-based perception techniques to extract meaningful ecological insights from visual data. Through the convergence of robotics, artificial intelligence, and ecology, the lab contributes tools that support sustainable wildlife conservation and environmental research.
