The lab’s research in agricultural robotics addresses the challenges of precision farming and sustainable food production through the integration of robotics, artificial intelligence, and multimodal sensing. Significant efforts are devoted to crop health monitoring and disease detection using deep learning and transformer-based vision models across a range of crops and fruit types. The lab develops robotic perception systems that combine visual, tactile, and language-based representations for assessing fruit maturity, firmness, and ripeness. Autonomous UAV- and robot-based platforms are designed for real-time field monitoring, yield assessment, and targeted agricultural interventions. The lab also investigates robotic pollination systems driven by deep learning and visual servoing to improve efficiency and resilience in agricultural practices. Additionally, the creation of large-scale benchmark datasets supports reproducible research and accelerates deployment of intelligent agricultural technologies.
